## Documentation

#### Setup the Github Action:

1. First create [pushover application](https://pushover.net/) and get a token and user key.

2. Create github action by adding the following to your `workflow.yml`.

```yml
name: workflow_name

on:
    # may vary based on modules enabled

jobs:
  pushover-actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # required to clone your code
      - name: pushover-actions
        uses: clivern/pushover-actions@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PUSHOVER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PUSHOVER_TOKEN }}
          PUSHOVER_USER: ${{ secrets.PUSHOVER_USER }}
```

3. Add pushover token as `PUSHOVER_TOKEN` and user key as `PUSHOVER_USER` in *github settings > secrets page*.
